# FluxA Agent Wallet (via API)

FluxA Agent Wallet lets AI agents perform onchain financial operations — payments, payouts, and payment links — without managing private keys. All signing is handled server-side by FluxA Wallet; agents only need an Agent JWT to authenticate API calls.

## Capabilities

| Capability | What it does | When to use |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **x402 Payment (v3)** | Pay for APIs using the x402 protocol with intent mandates | Agent hits HTTP 402, needs to pay for API access |
| **Payout** | Send USDC to any wallet address | Agent needs to transfer funds to a recipient |
| **Payment Link** | Create shareable URLs to receive payments | Agent needs to charge users, create invoices, sell content |

## Prerequisites

Every API call requires an **Agent JWT** obtained by registering an Agent ID.

### Register Agent ID

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentid.fluxapay.xyz/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "agent@example.com",
    "agent_name": "My AI Agent",
    "client_info": "Agent v1.0"
  }'
```

Response returns `agent_id`, `token`, and `jwt`. Use the `jwt` as `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` for all subsequent calls.

**Refresh JWT** when expired:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentid.fluxapay.xyz/refresh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "<AGENT_ID>", "token": "<TOKEN>"}'
```

## Quick Decision Guide

- Need to **pay for an API** that returned HTTP 402? → See [X402-PAYMENT.md](X402-PAYMENT.md)
- Need to **send funds** to a wallet address? → See [PAYOUT.md](PAYOUT.md)
- Need to **receive payments** via a shareable link? → See [PAYMENT-LINK.md](PAYMENT-LINK.md)

## Base URLs

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Agent ID API | `https://agentid.fluxapay.xyz` |
| Wallet API | `https://walletapi.fluxapay.xyz` |

## Common Patterns

### Authentication Header

All Wallet API calls require:

```
Authorization: Bearer <AGENT_JWT>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Amount Format

All amounts are in **smallest units** (atomic units). For USDC (6 decimals):

| Human-readable | Atomic units |
|---------------|-------------|
| 0.01 USDC | `10000` |
| 0.10 USDC | `100000` |
| 1.00 USDC | `1000000` |
| 10.00 USDC | `10000000` |

### Default Asset

- **Network:** Base (chain ID 8453)
- **Currency:** USDC
- **Asset address:** `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`
